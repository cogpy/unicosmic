A 3D wave pattern is created by the counter                          {2,5,8} rotates into
rotation of the icosahedrons triangles. From an                      {1,7,4)={3,3,3}
axis view diagram A represents a stationary       6
position. Diagram B 30° rotation and diagram C                       {2,5,8} then rotates into
a 60° rotation.                                                      {7,4,1}={9,9,9}
                                                                     {2,5,8} finally rotates into
                                                                     {4,1,7}={6,6,6}

                                                                                    3
When we apply the VBM system to a three dimensional structure the
Merkaba is generated. We can notice that the sequence {1,4,7} rotates
in a clockwise direction as seen in the diagram. Likewise the {2,5,8}
rotates in a counterclockwise direction. This is based on reference plane
and following the numbers in increasing order.                                              5
                                                                            8
If we apply these sequences to the I Ching (Book of Change) we can get
the following system:
        1                                     2
3       4   Father; force (CW         6      5 Mother; field; (CCW                  9   2
        7                                    8
            rotation)                           rotation)
The numbers 3 and 6 were arbitrarily assigned to the symbols, but seem
appropriate given the number of segment represented.
                                                                                                1

Now we apply this system to           If we change the rotation of one of       4
the remaining child trigrams:         the parents then the child trigrams
                                      become:
