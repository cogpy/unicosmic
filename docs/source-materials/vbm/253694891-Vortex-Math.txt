1) The first 24 numbers are part of a repeating sequence, and when they are placed around the
circle, a beautiful symmetry appears, that relates directly with the 60degree segments in a circle
(360deg/6). This might also be related to the 24 rays of the prime number cross!
2) Notice how all the opposite numbers always show up together: 1-8, 2-7, 4-5, 3-6, 9-9. This pattern
is connected to the Vedic Square because the columns in the vedic square have the same 1-8, 2-7,
4-5, 3-6, and 9-9 patterns. So thru digital roots, there is a connection between Phi and the ancient
Vedic square.
3) The digital root of the doubling sequence gives the repeating numbers 1-2-4-8-7-5. It turns out that
1/7 has the same repeating sequence of numbers except in a slightly inverted order: 1-4-2-8-5-7
Note that 22/7 is often considered the most natural approximation for pi. And within those numbers
we see the same 1-8, 2-7, and 4-5 pattern - without the 3,6,9 (which form the 'frame' in the diagram)
Digital roots and vortex maths are very exciting...
